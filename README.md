# Design Patterns in TypeScript

This repository is referenced from [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

It contains TypeScript examples for all classic GoF design patterns. Each pattern includes two examples:

- [x] **Conceptual** examples show the internal structure of patterns, including detailed comments.

- [x] **RealWorld** examples show how patterns can be used in real-world web applications.

## Requirements

For simplicity reasons, the examples are console apps. In order to launch them, you have to install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer and then install [TypeScript compiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and [TypeScript Node extension](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) like this:

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```

When you have all the required software installed, the examples can be launched via the command line as follows:

```
ts-node Example.ts
```
