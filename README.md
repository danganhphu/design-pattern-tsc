# Design Patterns in TypeScript

## Requirements

For simplicity reasons, the examples are console apps. In order to launch them, you have to install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer and then install [TypeScript compiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and [TypeScript Node extension](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) like this:

```
yarn global add typescript
yarn global add ts-node
```

When you have all the required software installed, the examples can be launched via the command line as follows:

```
yarn start
```
